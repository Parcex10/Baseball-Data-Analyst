# Baseball-Data-Analyst
Im a data scientist in progress. Here you can see my real passion. Being venezuelan born, i've been taugh to have baseball in my veins. I've played my whole life (20 years old) and I am lucky to know and train Randy Arozarena's personal trainer and other personalities. He is one of my mentors, just like a college teacher.
